## About
An opinionated changelog generator inspired by ruby [github-changelog-generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator) gem,
written <s>k</s>completely in kotlin and compiled as a native image to avoid any
external dependencies.
Generates changelog using github-based data such as tags, issues, PRs.

Avoiding "external" dependencies (such as ruby) is the main motivation for this project.
